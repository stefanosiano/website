**[Sentry](https://sentry.io/)** is an Application Performance Monitoring and Error Tracking solution.
I joined in 2022. Since then I:
* Led development of profiling feature in the Android SDK used by production Android apps, including frame rendering metrics, CPU, and memory usage
* Improved app startup and responsiveness insights by implementing TTID and TTFD metrics and fixing warm-start detection
* Refactored database instrumentation by moving logic from the Gradle plugin into the runtime SDK, reducing bytecode manipulation and eliminating crash scenarios
* Introduced benchmarking and UI test infrastructure to improve SDK stability and prevent performance regressions
* Worked closely with internal teams and external developers to improve app stability, performance, and observability
