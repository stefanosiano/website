**Specto** was a mobile profiling monitoring solution, [acquired by Sentry](https://sentry.io/about/press-releases/sentry-acquires-analytics-firm-specto-to-add-continuous-profiling-to-mobile-application-monitoring/).
I joined a team of 7 people, in 2021, right before the acquisition.
In this short time I:
* Worked on the Android profiling SDK used to monitor performance of production applications
* Wrote Unit and UI tests
* Learned custom Gradle plugins
